Hi! üëãüèª  I'm Kelsey - A Support Engineer in Austin, TX. I work on [Ruby on Rails](https://rubyonrails.org/) and [React](https://reactjs.org/) code at [Pingboard](https://pingboard.com/).

I fell in üíô with coding in college but didn't pursue it as a career until 2017 after graduating from [The Flatiron School](https://flatironschool.com/) online coding bootcamp program.  You can read more about the beginning of my coding journey [here](https://medium.com/@kelseyhuse/15-years-from-hacker-to-developer-135aacec9992).  I feel so much joy from coding and problem solving, and feel grateful that I have the opportunity to do something I love everyday. I also find satisfaction in sharing my knowledge through teaching, and want to give the younger generation the chance to discover if they have the same passion that I do, and to give them the superpower of creating things through code.  That's why for the past 3 years I've taught workshops and classes with [TechGirlz](https://www.techgirlz.org/), [Coded by Kids](https://www.codedbykids.com/), and [Belmont Charter Schools](http://www.belmontcharternetwork.org/) in Philadelphia, [Girls Who Code](https://girlswhocode.com/) in New York City, and now help with curriculum when I can for [Code2College](https://code2college.org/) here in Austin.

*I have an obsession with Philadelphia after living there from 2016-2018. [Gritty](https://twitter.com/GrittyNHL) is everything.*

Learning to code was tough.  There's always _so much_ to learn and it's easy to fall into thinking I'm inadequate in what I _do_.  However, as of the creation of this blog (early 2019), I no longer feel like an imposter in the tech world.  *I can code* and I feel confident in what I know. However, I'm still learning.  I've made a lot of mistakes in my work.  From not picking the right technologies for projects or setting realistic expectations, to not writing tests when I should have, because I didn't know how.  This is meant to be a documentation of my journey to developing my craft as a Software Developer.  I hope it can help others on their own path, and provide an example to future-me of the growth I'll hopefully have shown.
