Working in Support for a Software company means often receiving requests to uncover "who changed \<insert piece of data here\>?"

When I worked in Application Support for a Healthcare EMR company from 2012-2014, it was crucial for my clients to figure out who modified confidential patient information, especially in large healthcare entities where hundreds of users had access to patient records.  It was frustrating for someone in billing to update patient information and the next day see that someone else had changed it back.  It could mean missing out on substantial amounts of insurance claim remittance money for the organization. ðŸ’¸

When I would troubleshoot these types of issues, I was limited in the data I had access to.  Our SQL tables had a few fields that point me to the answer _if I was lucky_. I was able to see:
- `created_by` (a user_id)
- `created_at` (a timestamp)
- `updated_by` (a user_id)
- `updated_at` (a timestamp)

Everytime a user makes an update to information in the database, it would update the `updated by` field to their user ID and the `updated at` field to the time it occurred.

If multiple people had touched that piece of data, I didn't have any history of it. I could see the ID of last user, but it was often the ID of the user who corrected the bad data.  Not a helpful data model!

On my first day at Pingboard in Sept 2018, I looked through the internal Wiki pages and wrote down `Look into Paper Trail Gem` as a to-do item.

Our app is a Ruby on Rails app, which means we can use gems (a type of plugin/package for Rails apps).  This gem enables us to track the history of chosen data models within our app.

Like most apps (including the healthcare software I previously worked with), we have a `User` model.  In the Ruby model file, including the line `has_paper_trail` indicates that the app should track the different versions of that model in our database.  Papertrail uses a table called `Versions` to store all of this data.  The relationship between the model and the Versions table is a one-to-many relationship since `One` User row has `Many` previous version rows containing snapshot information of the model.

Having a Versions table means having the ability to view WHO and WHEN all changes to a piece of data were made.  This is especially valuable in apps where data is owned by multiple people, or there are multiple admins who have access to modify data.  It sure makes my life a lot easier as a Support Engineer, because answering "who changed \<insert piece of data here\>?" is as simple as finding the ID of the model and then running `user.versions` in a Rails console.

Papertrail is able to identify who changed the data by attaching itself to the `current_user` method often defined in a Rails application controller.  As long as data is changed through the app, there is a record of "Whodunnit" (this is the term Papertrail uses in its data model!).  However, if data is manipulated through a Rails console or external API calls, there may not be a current_user set.  It's important to keep this in mind when allowing data manipulation through new channels so that the user/system changing data is captured.

Similarily to another Version Control system most developers are familiar with (Git), keeping track of different versions allows a person to revert back to a previous version if necessary.  Papertrail has a method called `reify` that an be called on an instance of a Version to revive that model back to the state in the specified version. This is super handy when a lot of unwanted changes happen in an app!

In an app where data is changed often, this Versions table could become extremely bloated and expensive.  Papertrail gives you the ability to configure a limit of versions saved.  At Pingboard, we keep a record of 40, [which is documented in our security information](https://pingboard.com/security).

I highly recommend adding the Papertrail Gem to any Rails app where data is owned by multiple users.  It may be overkill and wasteful in an app where data is always owned by one user, and unable to be changed by anyone else.
